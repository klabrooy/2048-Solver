# 2048-Solver
AI uses Dijkstra's algorithm and max heap data structure

## Introduction
A solver for the [2048 game](http://2048game.com/) which uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find a path to the highest score (most rewarding state).

## Usage

Run the following on the command line:
      
      ./2048 ai [max/avg] [depth] slow
      
Where 
* [max/avg] is either max or avg, to select the option for propagationg scores
* [depth] is an integer number indicating the depth search
* "slow" will slow the ai to watch it play
